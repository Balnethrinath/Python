compiler:
1)Translate the entirety of the source code to machine code before execution
2)Tend to have faster execution speeds compared to interpreted languages
3)Require additional time before testing to complete the entire compilation step
4)Generate binary code that is platform-dependent
5)Are prevented from finishing when compilation errors occur


Interpreter:
1)Translate each command in source code to machine code, and then execute it before moving on to the next command
2)Tend to have slower execution speeds than compiled languages because they translate the source code at run time
3)Are often more flexible, with features like dynamic typing and smaller program size
4)Generate binary code that is platform-independent because interpreters execute the program source code themselves
5)Debug the source code at run time
